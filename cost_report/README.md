Make sure you have Python `3.11.3` installed on your system before using pip to install packages. 
If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/). 
Once Python is installed, you can use pip to manage your Python packages.

**Install Pandas**:
Pandas is a powerful data manipulation and analysis library. You can install it using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas
```

**Install UUID**:
The uuid module is part of Python's standard library, so you don't need to install it separately.

**Install OS**:
The os module is also part of Python's standard library, so there is no need to install it separately. You can import and use it directly in your Python code.
